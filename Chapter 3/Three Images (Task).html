<!--- Chapter 3 - Three Images [Task] --->

<!---
Task:
In a new index.html file display three images (that you would be legally allowed to use for a commercial project) and do the following:

- Select a theme which ties all three images together.
- Give each image an appropriate alt attribute.
- Give each image appropriate width and height attributes (retaining its original aspect ratio).
- Give each image an appropriate title attribute.
- Use CSS filters to change the appearance of all three of your images.
- Ensure each image is under 300kb.
- Underneath each image, provide information on its copyright license.
