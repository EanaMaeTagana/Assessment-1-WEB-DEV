<!--- Chapter 2 - One-Page Website [Task] --->

<!---
Task:
Pick a television series, film or game and design a really simple one-page website (just text, no images). Your website should include:

- An overview of the plot, key information, cast and/or creative team, characters and any reviews you can find.
- A nav bar at the top which allows the user to quickly navigate to sections further down the page (anchor Ids).
- A link to the actual website of the film/game etc. which opens in a new tab when clicked.
- Use of an external CSS file to style elements creatively (avoid inline styling and use classes instead).
- At least two classes.
- One link styled as a button.

            <p>Gripped by fear and with tensions in the group running high, you’ll be forced to make snap decisions that could mean life, or death, for everyone involved.</p>

            <h2>PLOT</h2>
            <p>"Until Dawn" centers around a group of eight friends who reunite at a secluded mountain lodge for a weekend getaway. 
                However, their plans for relaxation turn into a nightmare when they become trapped on the mountain and hunted by a masked killer. 
                As the night unfolds, the group discovers chilling secrets about the lodge's dark past, including the disappearance of two of their friends, Hannah and Beth, a year earlier. 
                Haunted by guilt and regret, the remaining friends must confront their fears and work together to survive the night. 
                Throughout their harrowing ordeal, players control the fate of each character through a series of choices and quick-time events. 
                These decisions not only shape the characters' relationships but also determine who lives and who dies as they struggle to outwit the relentless killer. 
                As tensions rise and alliances are tested, the true nature of the threat stalking them is revealed, leading to a heart-pounding climax where every decision counts. 
                Only by making the right choices can players hope to see the survivors make it through until dawn and escape the mountain alive.</p>

                    Best friends with Josh since grade school, he missed the prank on Hannah because he was drunk and asleep like Josh. 
                    Despite crushing on Ashley, he's too scared to advance their relationship.

                <strong>★★★★★ Tom Ruess</strong>: I enjoyed this game far more than I expected to! It’s very addictive and once I started I pretty much couldn’t put it down until I was done my first play through. I liked it so much I even rushed to the store after finishing to pick up ‘The Quarry’ for PS5 (this game’s sequel).

                <strong>★★★★★ Izzy Gardener</strong>: I played this earlier this year and still love it, I love that the different choices affect minor steps in the game as you have to think twice! I chose what I would of chose in the first game and saw what would happen and then played again trying the opposite, it’s so fun there’s so many endings and you can change so much! This game is super addicting seriously I’ve played it so many times now! I definitely recommend it to anyone who likes a spooky but fun and funny game.
