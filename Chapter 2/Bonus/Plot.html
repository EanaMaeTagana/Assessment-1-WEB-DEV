            <h2>PLOT</h2>
            <p>"Until Dawn" centers around a group of eight friends who reunite at a secluded mountain lodge for a weekend getaway. 
                However, their plans for relaxation turn into a nightmare when they become trapped on the mountain and hunted by a masked killer. 
                As the night unfolds, the group discovers chilling secrets about the lodge's dark past, including the disappearance of two of their friends, Hannah and Beth, a year earlier. 
                Haunted by guilt and regret, the remaining friends must confront their fears and work together to survive the night. 
                Throughout their harrowing ordeal, players control the fate of each character through a series of choices and quick-time events. 
                These decisions not only shape the characters' relationships but also determine who lives and who dies as they struggle to outwit the relentless killer. 
                As tensions rise and alliances are tested, the true nature of the threat stalking them is revealed, leading to a heart-pounding climax where every decision counts. 
                Only by making the right choices can players hope to see the survivors make it through until dawn and escape the mountain alive.</p>
