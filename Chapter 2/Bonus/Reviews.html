                <strong>★★★★★ Tom Ruess</strong>: I enjoyed this game far more than I expected to! It’s very addictive and once I started I pretty much couldn’t put it down until I was done my first play through. I liked it so much I even rushed to the store after finishing to pick up ‘The Quarry’ for PS5 (this game’s sequel).

                <strong>★★★★★ Izzy Gardener</strong>: I played this earlier this year and still love it, I love that the different choices affect minor steps in the game as you have to think twice! I chose what I would of chose in the first game and saw what would happen and then played again trying the opposite, it’s so fun there’s so many endings and you can change so much! This game is super addicting seriously I’ve played it so many times now! I definitely recommend it to anyone who likes a spooky but fun and funny game.

                <strong>★★★★★ Yves Roschlenova</strong>: Love story driven games, love horror, and absolutely love this game. It's like the choose your own adventure books I loved as a kid, manifested into a survival horror game that plays like an interactive movie. Outstanding. Have also played the first installment of The Dark Pictures Anthology, Man of Medan, will definitely be getting any and all games these guys release like this

                <strong>★★★★★ Laura Brearley</strong>: This game is so visually beautiful, has dynamic characters, and a fantastic story line. It is a truly amazing concept, which becomes more layered and complex each time I play. I highly recommend it.
